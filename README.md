## Project Overview
This Mod 3 Final Solo project is used to demonstrate my understanding of React, Router, and asynchronous JavaScript.  The app that I built allows fans of the Dallas Mavericks to view stats from each player on the team.  These stats are being pulled from an API and updated every 10 minutes.

## Goals
* Display a solid understanding of React and Router
* Use asynchronous JS
* Write strong unit and integration tests
* Become more familiar with formatting data when pulling from an API

## Technologies And Tools
> * React
> * React Testing (with Jest)
> * Router
> * JavaScript
> * JSX
> * CSS
> * git
> * GitHub
